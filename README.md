Implementation of [Loss Landscape Sightseeing with Multi-Point Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03867).

![](images/main-image.png)

To implement the results you will need to clone this repo (note the `--recursive` flag which is needed since we use submodules) first:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/universome/loss-patterns
```

And then install [firelab](https://github.com/universome/firelab) and run the following command:
```
firelab start configs/icons-mask-hpo.yml
```
